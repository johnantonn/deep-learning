## Contents
The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will help participants understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare them to engage with the development of leading-edge AI technology. 

Main topics of this specialization:
 - Build and train neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers.
 - Learn how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization.
 - Master theoretical concepts and their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow
 - Tackle real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing
